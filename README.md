My process
- My process was using what i learned leveraging the information i got from W3 schools in addition to looking at other sites such as mozilla documentation as well as stackoverflow and utilizing AI such as Chatgpt for assistance with cathcing errors.

What I learned
 
This was my first ever webpage of any kind that i built from trying to replicate a jpeg design that was given to me. I used the knowledge i have learned of the last month to build this website using Html and CSS while utilizing my knowledge of Flexbox and media queries to design and position. In addition i practiced with HTML semantics by displaying the Header, footer and where content was displayed.



Continued development

After this project I would like to get better at structuring my Html and creating more media queries. In addition i would first create this site using a mobile first view and then create a media query for the browser so that the structure of the css flows a bit more.
